Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis Tool

Retired codebase where a Java based general purpose M&S environment with
OpenGL based visualization was being built.  After Java3D became essentially
unsupported, an attempt to recreate similar functionality leveraging JavaFX
OpenGL capability was started.  Then, JavaFX was dumped with an unknown
future (lets face it, Swing is much nicer than JavaFX).  Even Swing is
losing official support.  So, Java is just being dropped on this site in
general w.r.t. any further development and replaced by modern C++ or
Rust, depending on what is best suited for the particular project.
